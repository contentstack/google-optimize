# Implementing A/B Testing for Contentstack-powered Websites Using Google Optimize

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the center. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

A/B testing refers to the process of displaying two variations of a web page to different segments of your website visitors. These variations are basically personalized content targeted to test which one drives more conversion. By using the results of A/B testing, you can determine the winning variation and then optimize your website for better results.

Google Optimize is a popular open-source website optimization tool that helps businesses to run A/B tests on their websites along with integrated analytics for smarter business decisions.

## Tutorial

In this guide, we will discuss the steps to implement A/B testing on a sample e-commerce website using Google Optimize. The goal is to determine which variant of the navbar, on the website, is driving conversions - "sticky" navbar or "non-sticky" navbar.
